Chatbots are Artificially-Intelligent Softwares showing 
responsiveness towards the existing queries. Those queries 
may either be of a student or an employee, depending 
upon the requirements in real-times. But this project will 
promisingly let the beginners prepare a software whose 
database is cloud-based and let a student get responses for 
the queries he/she may enter. Are you curious to know 
how this project will be identifying the answers? With 
NLP i.e Natural Language Processing and ML i.e Machine 
Learning algorithms, a list of appropriate responses will be 
entered in those chatbot's which will answer the questions 
(these are the input patterns) of a student in a goal-oriented 
manner. This is one of the reasons why the project is 
popular and preferred by many cloud-computing aspirants. 
Besides, the thing which canâ€™t be avoided in this project is 
connectivity with a website you are using. After the 
website is linked with the chatbot, you will be able to 
analyze how many users have started talking with the 
chatbot and to what extent the project is accurately and 
precisely answering to the variety of visitors always 
waiting for someone to help them fulfill their requirements . How to proceed this question for a project demonstration
